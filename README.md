This repository includes all personal projects that I have worked on.

## List of Projects

### Project 1: Regression and Classification (Mental Health)
#### Project Predict Mental Health
Mental health is an area that is severely neglected, and can have very serious ramifications such as student self-harm and depression.<br>
Working in a university's health and wellness center, we have been tasked to identify students at risk using data so that we can help them as early as possible.<br>
In this project, we will explore a dataset obtained from domestic and foreign students studying in a Japanese university. We will be training our data on various models to predict two tasks:<br>
(1) A regression problem: Predicting depression severity (depression score) of a student<br>
(2) A classification problem: Predicting whether a student have thoughts of suicide<br>
Task 1's models would be evaluated and selected based on their RMSE, and task 2's models would be evaluated and selected based on their Accuracy and F1 scores.

### Project 2: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
#### Sales Analysis and Segmentation
With customer-centric marketing playing an important role in a business, we have been tasked to help a particular giftware online store to analyse their online sales data and also provide appropriate methods for customer segmentation. 

Hence, the store's sales data will be analysed to provide insights into the customer base. On the basis of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, the customers of the giftware online store will also be segmented into various meaningful groups using the k-means clustering algorithm, allowing the store owner to better understand the store's target audience and hence be able to market to the customers more effectively in the future. 

### Project 3: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
#### Credit Card Fraud Detection - Ongoing
Data with over 284,000 credit card transactions from European cardholders was analysed to find insights on features differentiating between the fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions. A Model was then trained to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
