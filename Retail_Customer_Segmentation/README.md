### By Gladys Pao

## Project Information
<b>Purpose of this project:</b><br>
With customer-centric marketing playing an important role in a business, we have been tasked to help a particular giftware online store to analyse their online sales data and also provide appropriate methods for customer segmentation. 

Hence, the store's sales data will be analysed to provide insights into the customer base. On the basis of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values, the customers of the giftware online store will also be segmented into various meaningful groups using the k-means clustering algorithm, allowing the store owner to better understand the store's target audience and hence be able to market to the customers more effectively in the future.
