# Project Mental Health Prediction

### By Gladys Pao

## Project Information
Mental health is an area that is severely neglected, and can have very serious ramifications such as student self-harm and depression.<br>
Working in a university's health and wellness center, we have been tasked to identify students at risk using data so that we can help them as early as possible.<br>
In this project, we will explore a dataset obtained from the research of Nguyen et al (2019), where the authors obtained a record of 268 questionaire results of depression, acculturative stress, social connectedness, and help-seeking behaviour by a cohort of local and international students. We will be training our data on various models to predict two tasks:<br>
(1) A regression problem: Predicting depression severity (depression score) of a student<br>
(2) A classification problem: Predicting whether a student have thoughts of suicide<br>

Task 1's models would be evaluated and selected based on their RMSE, and task 2's models would be evaluated and selected based on their Accuracy and F1 scores.
